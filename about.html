                    I was homeschooled all the way until college.

                     In highschool I was on KYEOT, a local highschool aged robotics organization that competes in the FRC robotics competition.

                     In my Junior year I was elected as leader of the Systems team, we did all the programming and wiring for the robot.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    We never won a competition, but the year I lead systems was the year we got the closest, losing by just six points.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     After highschool i went to Murray State University for a semester, but it didn't end up being a good fit and I dropped out.
